# Quoridor Game

![Quoridor Game](path_to_screenshot.png)

This is a Quoridor board game implemented using **React** with an AI player based on the **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm. The project helped me gain a deeper understanding of React's component-based structure and demonstrated how to integrate AI into a game environment.

## Features
- **React Framework:** Built with a structured React component architecture.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** AI opponent that makes strategic decisions.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Ensures both players have a valid path to their goal, a core rule of the Quoridor game.
- **Simple Bot:** Added for a more casual gameplay experience.
- **Multiple Game Modes:** Choose between playing against another player, the AI, or a simple bot.

## Game Modes

The game offers three different modes for players:
1. **2 Player Mode:** Play against a friend on the same device.
2. **Against AI:** Challenge a more strategic AI opponent powered by the MCTS algorithm.
3. **Against Bot:** Play against a simpler bot for a relaxed gameplay experience.

## Key Algorithms and Techniques

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
The **MCTS** algorithm is used to develop a sophisticated AI opponent that explores potential moves and outcomes by simulating many possible game sequences. This approach allows the AI to make statistically strong decisions during gameplay.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
In Quoridor, one key rule is that both players must have a reachable path to their goal. To enforce this rule, the **BFS** algorithm is used to check if both players have valid paths after every wall placement.

### React Component Structure
The project was also an excellent opportunity to refine my React skills, particularly in terms of:
- **Componentization:** The game is broken down into reusable components like `Board`, `Square`, and `Wall`.
- **State Management:** Efficient state handling to manage turns, board updates, and move legality checks.
- **Hooks & Context API:** Making use of Reactâ€™s modern hooks for state and side-effects, and Context API for global state sharing between components.

## What I Learned
This project allowed me to:
- **Master React's component-based architecture** and learn how to properly organize a project into reusable parts.
- **Implement complex algorithms** such as MCTS and BFS in a React environment.
- **Understand game state management** and user interaction in a web-based game.
- **Build an AI opponent** that can make strategic decisions.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quoridor-game.git
Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd quoridor-game
```
Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
```
Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
```
##Future Enhancements
Improved AI Performance: Optimize the MCTS algorithm for faster decision-making.
Multiplayer Mode: Add real-time multiplayer using WebSockets or Firebase.
Customizable Themes: Allow users to customize the board and player colors.
